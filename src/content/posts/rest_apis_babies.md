One thing to note before moving forward is that **everything on the internet** is formed of:

- text  
- images  
- videos  

And we collectively call it **data**, which lives on some computer, at some place in the world, which we call **servers**.

Also, for now, assume that an **API** is some sort of magical mechanism which can do wonders, which most companies create for different purposes.

## A Simple Example

Now imagine you visited [google.com](http://google.com) and searched for **weather today**.  
Let’s break down what you have actually done:

- When you hit **enter** or **search**, you have called a **Google API** in the background.
- Now the Google API will magically bring all search results in front of you from different sources in text, images, and video formats — aka **data**.

So in technical terms, when you search on Google, you have **“hit an API with your search query”**, and you get a response in some form of **data**.

## What an API Does

This is what an API does.

Now you may ask:  
**Does an API decide what search results to bring and what not?**

The answer depends on the maker of the API, which is usually done by **backend engineers**.

But in most cases, the job of an API is just to:

- take a request  
- deliver a response  

The inner logic or the magical aspect of how to figure out what to return is mostly written in **separate files**.
