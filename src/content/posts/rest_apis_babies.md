imagine you are in a restra and you order a dish …….. you  have probably heard this one before 
one thing to note before moving forward is that everything on the internet is formed of text, images & videos. And we collectively call it data which in some computer at some places in the world which we call servers
also for now assume that an API is some sort of magical mechanism which can do wonders which most companies create for different purposes
Now Imagine you visited [google.com](http://google.com) and search for weather today. lets break down what you have actually done
but in most cases the job of an api is just to take a request and deliver the response. The inner logic or the magical aspect is mostly written in seperate files.

**Imagine you are in a restaurant and you order a dish…**

You have probably heard this one before, so time for a real one.

---

One thing to note before moving forward is that everything on the internet is formed of text, images & videos. We collectively call it data, which is stored in some computer at some place in the world, which we call servers.

Also, for now, assume that an API is some sort of magical mechanism which can do wonders, which most companies create for different purposes.

Now imagine you visited [google.com](http://google.com) and searched for "weather today." Let's break down what you have actually done:

- When you hit enter or search, you have called a Google API in the background.
- Now the Google API will magically bring all search results in front of you from different sources in text/images/video formats (aka Data).

So in technical terms, when you search on Google you have “hit an API with your search query” and you get a response in some form of “data.”

---

This is what an API does.

Now you may ask: does an API decide what search results to bring and what not? The answer depends on the maker of the API, which is usually done by backend engineers.

But in most cases, the job of an API is just to take a request and deliver the response. The inner logic or the magical aspect is mostly written in separate files.
